Containment zone of essential implementable java programs intended for efficient usage for achieving world class feats.

## Description:
This repo is all about java codes and the many useful tasks which can be achieved by writing highly efficient programs fron java programming language. It contains many individual files and folders as well which contain crucial java programs to help a person achieve the solution to common system problems and minimize the workload of that individual to perform rigorous functions. Automation is the key, and I know that. But, in addition to that the code execution time also matters a lot. Keeping all these things in mind, presenting to all the holy persons visiting this repo, the most novel solutions to some of the commonly faced problems!

_**Problem 1:**_ YouTube Creators face problems to put hashtags separated by ','

_**Solution:**_ The java code outputs the string separated by ',' after the youtuber enters the list of hashtags separated by a single space ' '. The java file name which helps us to do this is named as **HashtagsSeparator.java**. The resultant output string can be copied and pasted in the _Add tags_ section of the youtube uploads page.

_**Problem 2:**_ Separately extracting email-ids and website urls is tedious!

_**Solution:**_ The java code breaks down the given string/paragraph into small chunks or tokens based upon a delimiter such as a space(' '). The tokens are then compared with the regular expressions of that of an email-id and of that of a website url separately. If it matches any of them, them are stored and later printed separately on the console. The java file name which helps us to do this is named as **EWExtractor.java**. The program makes use of java swing, which provides a rudimentary but cool GUI!

_**Problem 3:**_ Achieving a common orderly sequence of files and folders at a specific path is difficult and tedious!

_**Solution:**_ Tha java program first separates the files and folders present at the path location. It then renames them to orderly sequences of _File(s)_ and _Folder(s)_, based upon the choice of the user using the program. The files are renamed to the prefix specified, followed by the incrementing indices. Likewise, the folders are renamed to the prefix specified, followed by the incrementing indices.
